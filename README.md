The campus life super app is a one stop shop for students and all their needs while on campus. It has the cafeteria hours, location, and menu, the gym hours, occupancy, and location, a profile page for you, a home page of the school and the weather, and lastly, an assignments pages so you can see what is due and when. 

I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the coding. For my API, I used Meteo Weather API and for deployment I used GitHub. 

In the future, I would want to change the temperature to Fahrenheit, make the cafe menu an API, have a live gym occupancy tracker, and a better Assignment task manager.
